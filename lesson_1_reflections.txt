How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Pretty cool. Found out you can use diff -u oldfile newfile to compare two files. 
This should help debugging between versions go much more smoothly in the future! 




What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It is useful to never worry about having to save. 
But manually saving gives you the control to logically split up the work you do into the differen save versions.
