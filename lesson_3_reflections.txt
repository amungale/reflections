When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you would like to collaborate with other people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you are collaborating with others and they are making changes to the GitHub repository, then you can decide which udpates to pull to your computer.
