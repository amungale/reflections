What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would allow to me make experimental versions of the code i was working with, while maintaining a master working copy. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows a space to specify exactly which components of your repository you would like to include in your commit.
