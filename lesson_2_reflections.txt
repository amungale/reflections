What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would allow to me make experimental versions of the code i was working with, while maintaining a master working copy. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows a space to specify exactly which components of your repository you would like to include in your commit. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use git diff to see what changes you have made from your working directory, and git diff --staged to compare your staging area and most recent commit. This will allow you verify that you have only made one logical change when commiting.
